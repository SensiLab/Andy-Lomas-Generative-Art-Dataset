This repository contains a collection of 1,774 images created by computational artist [Andy Lomas](http://www.andylomas.com/).
The images were created using a customised cell growth model developed by the Artist [1].
Forms were evolved using Lomas' *Species Explorer* software [2].
In addition to the images, a csv file contains information on the parameters used to generate each form, along with an artist-assigned aesthetic ranking (0-10) and categorisation.
